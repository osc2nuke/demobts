osCommerce-2334-bootstrap
=========================

osCommerce 2.3.3.4 with Bootstrap, what more needs to be said.  

The point is to try to keep changes to a minimum as this will allow easy porting of Addons.


This will be an ongoing COMMUNITY effort.

Installation
============

Install as if this is a new osCommerce installation.  Then enter the admin area and turn on 3 new Header Tag modules;

1.  colorbox
2.  datepicker
3.  grid/list view

The functionality of these have been moved to header tag modules so that the site will only load them on the pages needed rather than on all pages.  Admin > Modules > Header Tags > {install}

You also need to install other components such as the logo, breadcrumb, footer boxes, side column boxes and so on.  Admin > Modules > Boxes > {install}.  Boxes can be sorted using the sort order, lowest is displayed first.
